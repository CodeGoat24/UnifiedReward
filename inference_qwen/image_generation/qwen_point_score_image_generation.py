Alignment with the Caption: Assess how well this image aligns with the provided caption. Consider the accuracy of depicted objects, their relationships, and attributes as described in the caption.\n2. Overall Image Quality: Examine the visual quality of this image, including clarity, detail preservation, color accuracy, and overall aesthetic appeal.\nExtract key elements from the provided text caption, evaluate their presence in the generated image using the format: \'element (type): value\' (where value=0 means not generated, and value=1 means generated), and assign a score from 1 to 5 after \'Final Score:\'.\nYour task is provided as follows:\nText Caption: [{prompt}]'
